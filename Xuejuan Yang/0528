09 Palindrome Number: highest position and lowest position to compare 
In order to find the highest position, we should frist find the div
and while loop if x != 0

03 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
using left and right two pointers to find the length in which no duplications
and using boolean[] used to track whether this character used before or not

06 Zigzag conversion
using StringBuilder array to write all the chars from 0 to n 
then append all the stringBuilders together

07 Reverse Integer
x*10 + last num = new X
123 
0*10 + 3
3*10 + 2
(3*10+2)+1
...
!!! check overflow, so using long

02 add two numbers
lists
sum  += l1 + carry
sum += l2+ carry
check carry

01 Two sum
map to store the nums and its indices

19 Remove Nth Node From End of List
fast and slow pointers
fast go Nth first 
and need DummyNode (head removed)

13 Roman To Integer
add all first
if (Iv), sum-= 2
